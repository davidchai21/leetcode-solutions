This question is not that hard if we got the idea correctly. Comparing to 105, we can see that using stack is very convenient and can do it in linear time.

The reverse sequence of Postorder traversal would be the reverse order from the root relative to the preorder traversal. And there is not so much difference to the reverse sequence of inorder traversal. Based on this, we can follow the idea in 105 to do the problem from the tail of both vectors.
